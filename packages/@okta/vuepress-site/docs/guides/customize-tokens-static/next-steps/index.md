* [Include App-specific information in a custom claim](/docs/guides/customize-tokens-returned-from-okta/create-app-profile-attribute/)
* [Customize tokens with a Groups claim](/docs/guides/customize-tokens-groups-claim/)
* [Customize tokens returned from Okta with a dynamic allow list](/docs/guides/customize-tokens-dynamic/)
